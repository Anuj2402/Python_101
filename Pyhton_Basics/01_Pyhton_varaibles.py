'''
In Python, variables are used to store data or values that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. Python is a dynamically typed language, 
so you donâ€™t need to explicitly declare the type of a variable; its type is determined by the value assigned to it.

Type	Example
Integer	x = 10
Float	y = 3.14
String	name = "Alice"
Boolean	is_valid = True
List	numbers = [1, 2, 3]
Tuple	coordinates = (10, 20)
Dictionary	person = {"name": "John"}
Set	unique = {1, 2, 3}

#string and integer
name = "Anuj"
email = "bro123@gamil.com"
age = 23


print(f"your name is {name}");
print (f"your email is {email}");
print(f"your AGE IS {age}");
print('\n');
#float 
pi = 3.14;
gpa = 3.5;
distance = 10.5;
print(f"The fixed value of pi is {pi}");
print(f"You gpa for the semester is {gpa}");
print(f"The distance between two cities is {distance}");
